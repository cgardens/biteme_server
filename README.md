# Bite Me Api

##Summary
A voice-controlled recipe app that makes cooking from a recipe a hands-free experiences.

We developed the project in the MEAN stack on decoupled architecture which allowed us to develop both a web app and a mobile app concurrently. Checkout the [Bite Me Angular Client](https://github.com/cgardens/biteme_client) and the [Bite Me Ionic Client](https://github.com/cgardens/biteme_ionic_client) to see the accompanying Angular and mobile front ends.

This was a one-week project at DBC.

##Routes

###Recipe Routes

####Search Recipes (from Big Oven):
type: GET
http://localhost:3000/recipes/search?term=YOURSEARCHTERM

####Get Recipe By RecipeID (from Big Oven):
type: GET
http://localhost:3000/recipes/:recipeID

sample ID: 175169


###User Auth Routes

####Sign Up

http:localhost:3000/users/signup

  this request needs the following key-value pairs:

  email: user@email.com

  username: username

  password: password

  firstName: firstname

  lastName: lastname

  this request will return a json object with the following information:

```
{
  "type": true,
  "data": {
      "__v": 0,
      "password": "123",
      "email": "ralph@test.com",
      "_id": "54e17397a05f37ef0a82c44d",
      "customRecipes": [],
      "recipes": []
  },
  "token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJfX3YiOjAsInBhc3N3b3JkIjoiMTIzIiwiZW1haWwiOiJyYWxwaEB0ZXN0LmNvbSIsIl9pZCI6IjU0ZTE3Mzk3YTA1ZjM3ZWYwYTgyYzQ0ZCIsImN1c3RvbVJlY2lwZXMiOltdLCJyZWNpcGVzIjpbXX0.oMDZxitchaGOcGZz4qUMFHpC6Y7yyjV5kSGG1ycabTs"
}
```

  you need to save the token in order to make requests to the biteme api for protected info.

  you should also at least hang onto the _id, as that is the value needed to request user-specific information.

####Authenticate a User (i.e. Login)
type: POST
http:localhost/authenticate

This route requires a valid email and password
username: user@dbc.com

password: 123

####Check Authorization
The following is needed as header when trying access user-specific information.

```
